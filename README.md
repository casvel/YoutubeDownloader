# YoutubeDownloader
A ruby script for download mp3 from Youtube. It uses the API for [Youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) and the API for [YoutubeInMP3](http://www.youtubeinmp3.com/api/).

## Quick start
In order to use this script you will need to have an API key enabled for Youtube. If you don't have one, you can get one  [here](https://console.cloud.google.com). Remember to enable the YouTube Data API v3.

Once you get your API key you need to save it inside the file `~/.config/youtubedownloader/apikey`, or use the option `-k, --key=<path>` to give to the script the path where the key is stored.

## Usage
```
  Options:
      -m, --mode=<s>           Type of the download (list, video, search).
      -q, --query=<s>          What to download. For list and video should be the id, for search should be a query.
      -o, --out=<s>            Where the downloads will store. (Default: ~/Music)
      -k, --key=<s>            Path to the file with the API key. (Default: ~/.config/youtubedownloader/apikey)
      -u, --quiet              To silence the output.
      -a, --max-results=<i>    Max items to download. >= 1 (default: 25)
      -s, --skip=<i>           Skip the first <i> items of the query. >= 0 (default: 0)
      -i, --index=<i+>         Index(es) to download from a list (1-indexed). If multiple, separate with space.
      -h, --help               Show this message
```
The options `-m, --mode=<s>` and `-q, --query=<s>` are required. 
* For `-m list` the query should be the id of the playlist.
* For `-m video` the query should be the id('s) of the video(s). Multiple id's should be se separeted by comma (`,`)
* For `-m search` the query can be any string. It will download the number of videos specified by `-a, --max-results=<i>` returned by that query.

### Example
* `ruby youtubedownloader.rb -m list -q PLU_mcNMHvxilbbOnWFy4v4_nxxkMQ5r7l -o ~/Music/PTX`
* `ruby youtubedownloader.rb -m video -q 6Whgn_iE5uc,BB0DU4DoPP4`
* `ruby youtubedownloader.rb -m search -q "borro cassette" -a 1`
* `ruby youtubedownloader.rb -m list -q RDt6omUxqhG78 -i 1 3 2 8`

## Bugs
* Sometimes the file does not download correctly. I added 3 download retries, sometimes that works.

## TO DO
* Download videos.
* Download mixes (if possible).
* Think what else to add.
* Fix the bugs.
